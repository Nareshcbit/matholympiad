# Ultimate Clock‑Math Notes  
*For Middle‑School & Early Olympiad Students*

## 1. Anatomy of a Clock

| Part | Description | Key Facts |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Hour Hand** | Short, moves once around the dial every 12 h | 0.5° per minute (30° per hour) |
| **Minute Hand** | Long, moves once around the dial every 60 min | 6° per minute |
| **Second Hand** | Thin, moves once around the dial every 60 s | 6° per second |
| **Dial** | Circle divided into 12 major marks (hours) and 60 minor marks (minutes/seconds) | Full circle = 360° |

## 2. Angles on a Clock Face

### 2.1 Key Relationships
- **Minute hand speed:** 6° per minute  
- **Hour hand speed:** 0.5° per minute  

### 2.2 Core Formulas
| Quantity | Formula | Variables |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Minute‑hand angle from 12 | \(\theta_m = 6M\) | \(M\) = minutes past the hour |
| Hour‑hand angle from 12 | \(\theta_h = 30H + 0.5M\) | \(H\) = hour (0–11) |
| Angle between hands | \(\bigl|\theta_h - \theta_m\bigr|\) (if > 180°, subtract from 360°) | — |

### 2.3 Worked Examples
1. **3:15**  
   \[
   \theta_m = 6 \times 15 = 90^\circ,\quad
   \theta_h = 30 \times 3 + 0.5 \times 15 = 97.5^\circ
   \]  
   Angle = \( |97.5 - 90| = 7.5^\circ \)

2. **6:40**  
   \[
   \theta_m = 6 \times 40 = 240^\circ,\quad
   \theta_h = 30 \times 6 + 0.5 \times 40 = 200^\circ
   \]  
   Angle = \( |200 - 240| = 40^\circ \)

## 3. Coincidence, Opposition & Right Angles

| Concept | Formula (minutes \(M\) past hour \(H\)) | Notes |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| **Overlap** | \(M = \dfrac{60}{11}H\) | 11 overlaps in 12 h |
| **Opposite (180°)** | \(M = \dfrac{60}{11}(H + 6)\) | 11 oppositions in 12 h |
| **Right Angle (90°)** | \(M = \dfrac{60}{11}\Bigl(H \pm \tfrac{3}{2}\Bigr)\) | 22 right angles in 12 h |

---

## 4. Seconds‑Hand Problems

### 4.1 Triple Coincidence (All Three Hands)
- Relative speeds:  
  - Second vs. minute = 5.9°/s  
  - Minute vs. hour = 5.5°/min  
- First triple overlap after 12:00 ≈ 1 h 5 min 5.455 s.

### 4.2 Second–Minute Alignment
\[
\text{Second} = \frac{60}{59}M
\]  
Occurs every 59 s.

## 5. Fast, Slow & Broken Clocks

| Type | Key Idea | Sample Problem |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Fast Clock** | Gains \(x\) min per hour | “A clock gains 4 min per hour; what will it show after 6 real hours?” |
| **Slow Clock** | Loses \(y\) min per hour | “A clock is 10 min slow at 8:00 AM and loses 2 min per hour; when will it be correct?” |
| **Stopped Clock** | Reads same time continuously | “A stopped clock is correct twice a day.” |
| **Wrongly Set** | Incorrect initial setting | “Clock set to 12:00 at 2:00 PM; find next alignment.” |

## 6. Problem‑Solving Strategies

1. **Draw a Dial** to visualize positions.  
2. **Relative Motion**: Treat one hand as stationary.  
3. **Equation Setup**: Convert word problems to algebra.  
4. **Check Reasonableness**: Overlaps occur slightly after the hour mark.  
5. **Memorize Benchmarks**:  
   - Overlaps every 65 4⁄11 min  
   - Right angles every 32 8⁄11 min  
   - Oppositions every 65 5⁄11 min

## 7. Practice Problems

1. Find the angle at 2:50.  
2. When are the hands opposite between 3 and 4?  
3. List all right‑angle times between 9 and 10.  
4. How long after 5:00 will the hands overlap?  
5. A clock gains 3 min every 2 h. It is correct at noon. When will it next read 6:00 exactly when the true time is 5:48?

## 8. Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Minute‑hand angle | \(6M\) |
| Hour‑hand angle | \(30H + 0.5M\) |
| Angle between hands | \(\bigl|30H - 5.5M\bigr|\) (adjust to ≤ 180°) |
| Overlap times | \(M = \dfrac{60}{11}H\) |
| Opposite times | \(M = \dfrac{60}{11}(H + 6)\) |
| Right‑angle times | \(M = \dfrac{60}{11}\bigl(H \pm \tfrac{3}{2}\bigr)\) |
| Overlap interval | 65 4⁄11 min |
| Right‑angle interval | 32 8⁄11 min |
